# ucsb-chess-processing

This repository contains a working version of the code used by the Wilson Lab at UCSB (adapted from Jacob P. C. Ruff at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source), featuring a GUI for orienting and indexing stacked data. To run the GUI from the command line, use:

```
  > python tkinter_chess_queue.py
```
